# AI_ChatBot_Python
AI ChatBot using Python Tensorflow and Natural Language Processing (NLP) along side TFLearn
Hey Guys!! I made this contextual chat-bot using Python (mostly libraries like Tensorflow, TFlearn and NLTK.

Here, 
Tensorflow is required to build the graph of the neural network and 
TFlearn is used to fit connect the nodes of the graph as well as to make the graph learn by fitting it in the DNN (Deep neural network) Model.

NLTK(Natural Language ToolKit) is used for Natural Language Processing methods like stemming, tokenizing and converting the words to lowercase. 

And last but not the least to keep the project up-to-date,
The More You Analyze, More You Get Insights from the Data.
